Use the data_frutas.csv file provided as a dataset. A set of fruits are classified into four types (apple, tangerine, lemon and orange) taking into account their properties (weight, height, width, color). Write in a script lastname_name.py the necessary instructions to: 1) Show the total number of records for each type of fruit (3 points) 2) Show the weight vs fruit color on a scatter plot (3 points) 3) Using 75% of the data as a training set, (6 points) a) Show the adjustment score using SVM b) Show the adjustment score using Logistic regression 4) Select “round” fruits from the dataset (those that have width = height) as input data. Classify them using the method that obtained the best score (use a conditional statement to decide which one to use) and show the classification. (4 points) 5) Can you predict the weight of a fruit from its width and height? How much would a watermelon weigh if its height = 40.5 and its width = 35.0? (4 points)
